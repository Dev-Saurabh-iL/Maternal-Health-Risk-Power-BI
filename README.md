Which health conditions are the strongest indications for health risks during pregnancy?


**Context**

Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

   1. Age: Age in years when a woman is pregnant.
   2. SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
   3. DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
   4. BS: Blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, mmol/L.
   5. HeartRate: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
   6. Risk Level: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attribute.
